    /* Configure the files you would like to upload to Bintray and their upload path.
    You can define one or more groups of patterns.
    Each group contains three patterns:

    includePattern: Pattern in the form of Ruby regular expression, indicating the path of files to be uploaded to Bintray.
    excludePattern: Optional. Pattern in the form of Ruby regular expression, indicating the path of files to be removed from the list of files specified by the includePattern.
    uploadPattern: Upload path on Bintray. The path can contain symbols in the form of $1, $2,... that are replaced with capturing groups defined in the include pattern.

    In the example below, the following files are uploaded,
    1. All gem files located under build/bin/ (including sub directories),
    except for files under a the do-not-deploy directory.
    The files will be uploaded to Bintray under the gems folder.
    2. All files under build/docs. The files will be uploaded to Bintray under the docs folder.

    Note: Regular expressions defined as part of the includePattern and excludePattern properties must be wrapped with brackets. */
